## Proposal Deliverables ##
1. Study the design HDL
2. Write a detailed micro-architectural specification (to make sure you understand the design) 
	- Block Diagram
	- All FSMs' diagram
	- FSM state transitions
	- How the whole design works

3. Write a detailed functional coverage based test plan
	- I will spell out more details but it must include:
		- Unit level testing strategy 
		- Unit level TB block diagrams (tentative)
