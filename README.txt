hdl: All HDL files except the top level testbench. You will have to create all testbenches.
tests:
add01.as - PDP8 assembly language test. Reads values from two memory locations, adds them and writes the results to another memory location.
add01.lst - List file generated by PDP assembler (PAL). It has a breakdown of all opcodes and memory locations w/ values.
add01.mem - Obj (memory) file generated by PDP aseembler (PAL). This file has memory location and value compatible with verilog readmemh function.
test.mem - Same as add01.mem. Copied over and renamed becuase PDP8 memory module will look for a file called (test.mem)
out.mem.golden - Expected output (out.mem) generated by this test.
pal.exe - PDP8 assembler.
